# Bahar Web

This is the front end web application for Bahar.

## Getting Started

Install packages with `pnpm install`.

As you're working through the app, run `pnpm run --filter web messages:extract` to extract any new labels from the code into the `.po` files.

Then, when you are building the app run `pnpm run --filter web messages:compile` to prepare for a production build.
