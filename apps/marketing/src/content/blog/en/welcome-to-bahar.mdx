# Welcome to Bahar

Learning Arabic is a rewarding journey, but it can also be challenging. That's why we built **Bahar** - a modern, intuitive application designed to help you master Arabic vocabulary effectively.

## What Makes Bahar Different?

### Personal Dictionary

Unlike traditional flashcard apps, Bahar lets you build your own Arabic dictionary. Each word you add comes with:

- **Root analysis** - Understand the trilateral roots that form the foundation of Arabic
- **Morphological patterns** - Learn how words are formed and transformed
- **Contextual examples** - See words used in real sentences

### Smart Spaced Repetition

Bahar uses the **FSRS algorithm** (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) - the same technology that powers modern learning systems. This means:

- Words you struggle with appear more frequently
- Words you know well fade into longer intervals
- Your study time is optimized for maximum retention

### Bidirectional Learning

Study in both directions:
- **Arabic → English**: See the Arabic word, recall the meaning
- **English → Arabic**: See the English translation, recall the Arabic word

This dual approach strengthens both recognition and production skills.
